# Landing Page

## Description
This project aims to build a single page, beautifully styled website.
It aims to test my skills on HTML and CSS, to build a web page and to
style it using the available tools.

## What I Will Learn
I will come out of this having gotten more used to the standard git
work flow, with more familiarity with HTML to structure webpages
and with much more familiarity with CSS to give my webpage life
and beautify and structure it nicely.

## Uses
This is a nicely structured landing page for whatever websites I would
like to build in the future! Take the page and then customize it for
the job if required!
